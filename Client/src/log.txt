    Fixed the MutationDuplicate class so that it accepts a node as input
    rather than a program and mutates that node

    Mutations and Bugs
    
    Mostly created skeletons of mutation classes. Some bug fixes in

    More AST and Parser
    
    More changes to parser, but still not complete. Added a class for

    ParserImpl and Tokenizer changed
    
    Added to Tokenizer to handle java-style comments, but this needs to be
    tested. Added to ParserImpl so that it is close to completion and is a
    detailed skeleton of how it will eventually look, but requires the
    classes in the ast package to be completed before it can be fully
    completed
